# Rum Compass is a compass that doesn't point North

But we're not trying to find North, are we!

## ðŸ§ªðŸ§ªðŸ§ª Currently in BETA TESTING ðŸ§ªðŸ§ªðŸ§ª
This will point the user towards the nearest bar where he can refill his drink.
Upon arrival, the app will let you know you've made it.

## Tech

- React Native
- Designed in Expo for cross-functionality on iOS and Android
- expo-location
- Animate API (Included with React Native)
- Utilizes an external server that I set up for the web version of this app which communicates with the Google Maps API.

### Next Dev Steps:

- refactor calculateDistance & calculateBearing to the frontend or a separate route so API request is not made for simple recalculations

Backlog:
- spin the compass if location services are not enabled
